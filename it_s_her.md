# Before Dawn

I was looking upon the twilight
When she came with light steps
Across the ground
Without a sound
Someone blew out the candles
And my gaze fell on her face
Serene as a calm sky
Her eyes...shy

Black Cashmere
Wrapped around her arms
A secretive dark being
She has endless charms
And the twinkle of stars
Just for company
Beckoning to follow her
Gently, she tugs at me
Into the land of my dreams
She unshackles me
From my worldly bonds
And I fall
Like a single drop
Going upwards
.
.
.
Away
.
.
From the sea.

I am scared
I am satisfied

She is a paradox
Confluence of opposite polarities
Daughter of emptiness
Mother of festivity and lights
She splits me in two
The bat and the firefly
It is only in darkness
That light shines
At its brightest
Inspiring the hero
And the villain
Her deep darkness
Soothing
The dancing neon
Bright!

In some she incites
Promiscuity
Others find in her
A muse
A lover
And for the lone, lost traveler
Fear
And for the tired laborer?
A tiny death, everyday

She is a fair master,
Commanding the miscreants
The crusaders
The workers
The jokers
Hers is almost a magical spell
To some a sweet relief,
To some a harsh order

Her walk is...
Smooth
Slow
...Bored
Like a drawl
She wanders on,
Alone
No one waits at home
For her to get back
And lovers she has never known

A detached observer
A hypnotist
A savior
A merciless seductress
A cruel master
She's the reason for my Stockholm
Still...I love
The sweet, deep
Sadness of her face
I beg her to stay
Every. Time.
A laugh.
The sort of which moves the earth.
Her hair whips with the wind
The first light of dawn hits
And I am looking upon
Her
Walking awayâ€¦
