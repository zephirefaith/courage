# It's Her

I watched over the night
As she came with light steps on ground
She gently blew out the light
Her face serene, her voice a peaceful sound
Black Cashmere wrapped around her arms
She is a secretive, dark being
In her arsenal, she has endless charms
And the twinkle of stars for company
Gently, she tugs at my arm
Taking me where I’ve wanted to be
She sets me free from the worldly bonds
Like a single drop going away from the sea
I am scared
I am satisfied
Her deep darkness is soothing
The neon lights they harbor, too bright
She is a paradox
Confluence of opposite polarities
Daughter of emptiness and dread
Mother of festivity and lights
While in some she encites promiscuity
Others find in her a muse
Then there is the lone, lost traveler who fears her
And the tired laborer who welcomes a tiny death everyday
Fair in her judgement, she commands the miscreants
Also the crusaders, the workers and the jokers
Her words are almost a magical spell
To some a sweet relief, to some a harsh order
Her walk is a smooth, slow drawl
As she wanders on, alone
No one’s at home waiting for her to get back
And she has lovers whom she has never known
A detached observer
A hypnotist and a savior
A merciless seductress and a cruel master
She's the reason for my Stockholm
Still, I love the sweet sadness on her face
I beg her to stay every time
A laugh like windchimes, a movement of grace
The first light of dawn hits me as she walks away…
