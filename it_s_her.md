# Before Dawn

I watched over the night
As she came with light steps
Softly streaking on the ground
Someone blew out the candles
As my gaze fell on her face
The most serene vista
And her voice a peaceful sound
Black Cashmere
Wrapped around her arms
She is secretive
Dark being
In her arsenal,
She has endless charms
And the twinkle of stars
Just for company
Gently, she tugs at my arm
Beckoning me to follow her
To the land of my dreams
She unshackles me
From my worldly bonds
And I fall
Like a single drop
Going upwards and away
From the sea
I am scared
I am satisfied
Her deep darkness is soothing
The neon lights
Too bright
She is a paradox
Confluence of opposite polarities
Daughter of emptiness and dread
Mother of festivity and lights
In some she encites
promiscuity
Others find in her
A muse, a lover, a teacher
For the lone, lost traveler
Fear
And the tired laborer who welcomes
A tiny death, everyday
She is a fair master,
Commanding the miscreants
The crusaders, the workers
The jokers
Its almost a magical spell
To some a sweet relief,
To some a harsh order
Her walk is...
Smooth, slow, bored
Like a drawl
She wanders on,
Alone
No one waits at home
For her to get back
She does have lovers
But never known
A detached observer
A hypnotist and a savior
A merciless seductress
A cruel master
She's the reason for my Stockholm
Still, I love the sweet, deep
Sadness of her face
I beg her to stay
Every time
A laugh like windchimes,
A movement of grace
The first light of dawn hits
And I find I am watching
Her
Walking away, aching, emptyâ€¦
